        <p class="projectsHeading">Facebook Software Engineering Internship - Summer 2016</p>
        <p class="projectsList">I worked on the Real Time Infrastructure team at Facebook and improved performance for Messenger push notifications.</p>

        <p class="projectsHeading">Parallel SAT Solver - May 2016</p>
        <p class="projectsList">My partner and I parallelized the commonly-used DPLL algorithm to create an efficient k-SAT solver that achieved 4-5x speedup from the original sequential version. We implemented our parallel version using threads, caching, and various other optimizations.</p>
        <p class="projectsList">Technologies: C++</p>

        <p class="projectsHeading">C0 Compiler - Fall 2015</p>
        <p class="projectsList">My partner and I created an optimizing compiler from C0 (a safe subset of C designed at CMU) to x86-64 Assembly. My portion focused on designing and programming the lexer, parser, typechecker, and a register allocator.</p>
        <p class="projectsList">Technologies: OCaml</p>

        <p class="projectsHeading">Teaching Assistant for CMU's School of Computer Science - Spring 2014 to Present</p>
        <p class="projectsList">I've been a teaching assistant for intro-level CS courses at CMU ever since my freshman spring. I've helped over 1600 students through office hours, one-on-one help, group sessions, recitations, and grading. In the past, I've TA-ed <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/15122-s16/" target="_blank">15-122</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/" target="_blank">15-112</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110/index.html" target="_blank">15-110</a>.</p>

        <p class="projectsHeading">Cloud Raxak Software Engineering Internship - Summer 2015</p>
        <p class="projectsList">I worked at a cloud security start-up and primarily focused on two main projects. My first project involved creating a management console that flags keys and virtual machines in the Redis database that don't adhere to a specific model. This project involved repeatedly re-designing a model that factors in different kinds of VMs and allows our company to easily view and re-organize the database, as well as delete unnecessary values. My second project involved creating an editor that allows clients to create their own personalized security profiles with custom parameters for each rule. I also created a visually appealing way to view and edit security profiles as first steps toward an IDE for the editor.</p>
