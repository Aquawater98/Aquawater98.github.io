        <p class="classesTitle">Protecting Yourself Against Fraud: Understanding URLs</p>

        <p class="classesHeading">Introduction</p>
        <p class="classesList">
          Identity fraud is becoming increasingly common in a technology and Internet-driven society. It's important to protect yourself against other people stealing your identity online, and one way you can do this is to learn and understand URLs so that you don't get tricked into entering your personal and credit card information into a fraud website that may be trying to steal people's personal information. Many fraud websites contain URLs that may not initially seem suspicious to most people, but to people who understand the basic structure of URLs, certain indicators can be red flags. This webpage is dedicated to instructing you on better understanding URLs so that you can protect yourself against identity theft.

        <p class="classesHeading">URLs and Domains</p>
        <p class="classesList">
          URLs are unique identifiers for different webpages. One of Amazon's URLs for example, could be something such as "amazon.com/toys-for-children-baby-doll-492850". While webpages can have many URLs, they normally only have one domain name. The core part of a URL is a domain name: Amazon's domain name, for example, is "amazon.com". Websites can further have subdomains based off of their domain name. This means that websites can create separate pages of their main website, "amazon.com", by adding in dots before their domain name, such as "toys.amazon.com". This URL would still be owned by Amazon because it falls under the valid structure for creating subdomains, given that Amazon owns "amazon.com". In fact, further subdomains under "toys.amazon.com" could be created: URLs such as "boys.toys.amazon.com" or "toddler.boys.toys.amazon.com" would also be legitimate URLs.

        <p class="classesList">
          So if all those URLs are examples of real webpages by Amazon, then what kinds of URLs could be fake ones? Many people can be tripped up by seeing just the word "amazon" in the title of a URL, which people who make fraud websites take advantage of. For example, a URL such as "www.amazon-goods.com" or "buy.amazon325.com" may look legitimate at a brief glance, but it's important to note that the domain names of the examples above are really "amazon-goods.com" and "amazon325.com", respectively. Amazon does not own either of those domain names, so those websites are likely attempting to imitate Amazon's webpage.

        <p class="classesHeading">Path Names</p>
        <p class="classesList">
          Path names are normally part of a URL and are indicated by the part of the URL that comes after the first /. Path names are important because they can help us identify the authenticity of a URL. For example, a URL such as "www.amazon.com.goods.com/toys-toddlers" might look legitimate because it contains "amazon.com". However, it's important to take a look at everything before the first /. In reality, "goods.com" is the domain name of this URL, not "amazon.com". The easiest way to determine domain name is to start from the first / and work to the left. Most webpages will have a ".com" or ".net" or a similar extension, and the domain name is normally the name to the left of this extension. If this domain name is not the website name that you're expecting, then you should be wary of trusting this webpage with any personal information.

        <p class="classesHeading">Web Scraping</p>
        <p class="classesList">
          One common belief many people have when visiting a webpage is that even if the URL may look suspicious, all the icons, images, and general layout of the page are so sophisticated that no hacker would be able to replicate it and that it would be too much work to do. The links on the webpage may even work and link to legitimate pages. However, it's possible for hackers to perform something called "web scraping" that essentially copies the entire layout of the front page of Amazon so that everything looks identital to the real Amazon webpage. The links on the fake Amazon webpage will even redirect to links in the real Amazon webpage. However, upon entering personal information in the webpage, hackers will receive the unencrypted information and be able to then acquire personal information that unsuspecting victims provide. It takes very little effort for hackers to scrape a webpage, so this means that you should check your URLs carefully, even if the webpage you're looking at looks very legitimate and sophisticated.

        <p class="classesHeading">Conclusion</p>
        <p class="classesList">
          Now that you have a better understanding of URLs, hopefully you will be less likely to be a victim of identity theft in the future. Make sure to spread the knowledge you've learned here so others also are protected!
