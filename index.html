        <p>Hi! My name's Eileen, and I grew up in Pleasanton, California.</p>
        <p>I'm a senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in
        Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
        PA. I especially enjoy working in backend or full stack development, but
        I'm open to trying out different things. This past summer, I worked at
        Facebook and improved performance and internal tools for the Messenger
        push notification system. Some of my recent projects include writing a compiler from C0 (a subset of C) to x86-64 Assembly in OCaml, as well as writing a parallel SAT solver optimizing the DPLL algorithm in C++.</p>
        <p>I'm also very passionate about TA-ing and have taught well over 1600
        students at CMU in intro-level Computer Science courses throughout my
        seven semesters of TA-ing so far.</p>
        <p>I am currently seeking a full-time software engineering position
        after graduation. Feel free to get in touch with me! You can contact me at yuanj@andrew.cmu.edu.</p>
