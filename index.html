        <p>Hi! My name's Eileen, and I'm currently a backend software engineer
        at <b>Square</b> in San Francisco. I work on the <b>Customers
          Directory</b> team,
        which allows merchants to track and manage their customers. I received
        my B.S. in <b>Computer Science</b> at <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b> in
        May '17.</p>
        <p>One of my recent projects involves developing an algorithm to automatically identify and merge
        together duplicate customer profiles in Directory. This involves finding
        linkages via email and phone between customer profiles and merging the
        ones with a high degree of confidence into a common profile. Merchants
        are able to better identify who their buyers are and consolidate all the
        information for their customers, which is especially helpful for
        merchants whose customer count ranges in the tens or hundreds of
        thousands.</p>
        <p>Another one of my recent projects was creating a profile attachments
        feature in Directory. This feature allows merchants to attach PDFs or
        images to customer profiles. For example, a hair salonist could attach
        an image of a client's hair style to reference during the next
        appointment, or a driving school could attach permission slips as PDFs
        on customer profiles. This aligns with Directory's mission to allow
        merchants to convey all necessary information attached to a customer
        online instead of on paper.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to go hiking, workout in the gym, or explore
        one of SF's many parks.</p>
        <p>Feel free to get in touch with me! You can contact me at
