        <p>Hi! My name's Eileen, and I'm currently a backend software engineer
        at <b>Square</b> in San Francisco. I work on the <b>Customers
          Directory</b> team,
        which allows merchants to track and manage their customers. I received
        my B.S. in <b>Computer Science</b> at <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b> in
        May '17.</p>
        
        <p>One of my recent projects involves allowing merchants to <b>restore customers that they've accidentally deleted</b>. Previously, Directory did not have an "Undo Delete" feature, and it was common for merchants to accidentally delete large portions of or their entire Directory. I designed and implemented a feature that allowed merchants to recover these accidentally deleted customers. This required ensuring that not just the customer profile, but any of the customer associations, were also restored. Customer associations included payments that the customer had made in the past, marketing emails or feedback the customer had received, notes that the merchant had made under that customer, and more. This added a useful and necessary feature to Directory, as the inability to restore customers they had deleted was a big pain point for merchants.</p>

        <p>Another one of my recent projects involves developing an algorithm to <b>automatically identify and merge together duplicate customer profiles</b> in Directory. This involves finding
        linkages via email and phone between customer profiles and merging the
        ones with a high degree of confidence into a common profile. Merchants
        are able to better identify who their buyers are and consolidate all the
        information for their customers, which is especially helpful for
        merchants whose customer count ranges in the tens or hundreds of
        thousands.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I like to workout in the gym, read while sipping some hot chocolate, and explore one of SF's many parks or restaurants.</p>
